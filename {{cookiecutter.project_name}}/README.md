*THIS IS A FUNNY TAKE ON A GENERIC README, MAKE SURE TO CHANGE IT FOR SERIOUS PROJECTS*

Welcome to the readme for {{cookiecutter.project_name}}!

Congratulations on discovering the latest and greatest in tech right now.

This developer -> {{cookiecutter.author}} ({{cookiecutter.email}}) , spent countless hours coding, testing, debugging and sacrificing their sanity to make this software... workable.

We won't bore you with technical jargon, but we can assure you that this software is as stable as a Jenga tower during an earthquake. If you're feeling brave, we encourage you to use this software in production environments. After all, who needs boring stability when you can have the thrill of watching your computer magically turn into magma?

We hope you enjoy using our software as much as we enjoyed making it. Just remember, if it doesn't work, it's not our fault - it's yours for not having a good enough computer.
